This folder contain my test result for the JComponent.contains method.

*.java: my personal, modified code for testing purpose.
*-original.java: original code from textbook.
main class: CarMover.java



git repository for textbook code: https://bitbucket.org/cayhorstmann/oodp3code.git
Code I've used to modify: /ch06/car/*.java

//======================================================================//
Textbook Example:
The contains() method is CarShape's responsibility //not to confuse CarShape with standard Shape class, unrelated.

//======================================================================//
My Test case:
As you can see, wherever I click on the frame, CarComponent.contain() will return True.

Cause: further testing show that Component will expend and fill the gap of the rest of the container.
Console output show that even after hard coding the size of CarComponent by using CarComponent.setSize(x,y), CarComponent will eventually fill the rest of the container. 
Despite the graphical representation of CarComponent, generated by CarShape, only shows a little car, the physical space the Component occupy is completely different and unpredictable.
